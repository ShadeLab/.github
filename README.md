# Welcome to the research space of Ashley Shade's Research Program in Microbiome Resilience! 
#### As part of our epic Findability Crusade, here you can find our analysis code, links to publications and preprints, and links to public data.  We strive to provide triangulation among code, data, and publications so that no matter which information is discovered first, the other two are readily findable from each entry point.

#### While all public data are listed in the Readme file of each project, below is a list of our public data depsited on NCBI
| Accession   | Title                                                                                                                                                          | Links                    |
